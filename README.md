# Challenge-12: SQL Employee Tracker

## Description
This week, I created an employee database that utilizes SQL. By doing this, managing the employee's information is easier than ever. You can quickly view all departments, roles, and employees. On top of that, you can add employees, edit their job, change who manages who, and delete departments, roles, and employees.
